> "An AI that doesn’t just predict or chat — it senses, reasons, and acts in the real world, learning as it goes."

RA³ is a modular framework for autonomous intelligence that bridges the gap between statistical machine learning and symbolic logic. Unlike traditional "black-box" models, RA³ is grounded in physical reality, making its decisions transparent, predictable, and safely executable in high-stakes environments.

## 🧠 Core Methodology

RA³ operates on a continuous **SENSE → REASON → ACT → LEARN** loop:

1.  **Multimodal Perception**: Real-time integration of visual feeds, vibration sensors, and proximity data.
2.  **Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning**: Logical inference engines that check autonomous decisions against strict safety rules.
3.  **Actionable Decision Layer**: A hybrid system that balances goal optimization with safety-first fallbacks.
4.  **Online Learning**: Continual adaptation to environmental changes using incremental machine learning (River/Avalanche).

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Transparent Autonomy**: Logic logs explain *why* an action was taken, down to the symbolic rule.
- **Immediate Adaptability**: Learns from new sensor data in milliseconds without retraining the entire core.
- **Mission Control Dashboard**: A high-fidelity, real-time visualization of the AI's "thought process."
- **Deterministic Safety**: Mathematical guarantees that specific actions (like Emergency Stops) override probabilistic predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Reasoning**: Neuro-Symbolic Logic, Logic Tensor Networks.
- **Learning**: River (Online Machine Learning), Stable Baselines3 (RL).
- **Backend**: FastAPI, WebSockets, Python.
- **Dashboard**: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Recharts.
