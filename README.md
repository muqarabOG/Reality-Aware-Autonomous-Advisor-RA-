RA³ is a modular framework for autonomous intelligence that bridges the gap between statistical machine learning and symbolic logic. Developed by **Muqarab Nazir**, this framework is designed to sense reality, reason through logic, and act safely in physical environments.

## 🧠 Core Methodology

RA³ operates on a continuous **SENSE → REASON → ACT → LEARN** loop:

1.  **Multimodal Perception**: Real-time integration of visual feeds, vibration sensors, and proximity data.
2.  **Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning**: Logical inference engines that check autonomous decisions against strict safety rules.
3.  **Actionable Decision Layer**: A hybrid system that balances goal optimization with safety-first fallbacks.
4.  **Online Learning**: Continual adaptation to environmental changes using incremental machine learning (River/Avalanche).

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Grounded Vision (Path A)**: Real-time YOLOv8 object detection integrated directly into reasoning.
- **Goal Pursuit Engine (Path B)**: Autonomous navigation with dynamic steering and interactive tactical radar.
- **Safety Interlocks (Path C)**: Automatic pausing, evidence snapshotting, and manual reset protocols.
- **Voice Intelligence (Path D)**: Real-time verbal feedback on system status and reasoning alerts.
- **A* Tactical Pathfinding (Path E)**: Advanced waypoint generation for navigating complex obstacle fields.
- **ROS2 Bridge (Path F)**: Standardized messaging for physical hardware integration.
- **Transparent Autonomy**: Logic logs explain *why* an action was taken, down to the symbolic rule.
- **Mission Control Dashboard**: A high-fidelity, real-time visualization of the AI's "thought process."

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Reasoning**: Neuro-Symbolic Logic, Logic Tensor Networks.
- **Learning**: River (Online Machine Learning), Stable Baselines3 (RL).
- **Backend**: FastAPI, WebSockets, Python.
- **Dashboard**: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Recharts.
